            "text": "Theory and Usage\n\n\nzend-permissions-acl provides a lightweight and flexible access control list (ACL)\nimplementation for privileges management. In general, an application may utilize such ACLs to\ncontrol access to certain protected objects by other requesting objects.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this documentation:\n\n\n\n\na \nresource\n is an object to which access is controlled.\n\n\na \nrole\n is an object that may request access to a resource.\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, \nroles request access to resources\n. For example, if a parking attendant requests\naccess to a car, then the parking attendant is the requesting role, and the car is the resource,\nsince access to the car may not be granted to everyone.\n\n\nThrough the specification and use of an AC*, an application may control how roles are granted\naccess to resources.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nCreating a resource using \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n is very simple. A resource interface\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Resource\\ResourceInterface\n is provided to facilitate creating resources in an\napplication. A class need only implement this interface, which consists of a single method,\n\ngetResourceId()\n, for \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n to recognize the object as a resource.\nAdditionally, \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Resource\\GenericResource\n is provided as a basic resource\nimplementation for developers to extend as needed.\n\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n provides a tree structure to which multiple resources can be added. Since\nresources are stored in such a tree structure, they can be organized from the general (toward the\ntree root) to the specific (toward the tree leaves). Queries on a specific resource will\nautomatically search the resource's hierarchy for rules assigned to ancestor resources, allowing for\nsimple inheritance of rules. For example, if a default rule is to be applied to each building in a\ncity, one would simply assign the rule to the city, instead of assigning the same rule to each\nbuilding. Some buildings may require exceptions to such a rule, however, and this can be achieved in\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n by assigning such exception rules to each building that requires such an\nexception. A resource may inherit from only one parent resource, though this parent resource can\nhave its own parent resource, etc.\n\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n also supports privileges on resources (e.g., \"create\", \"read\", \"update\",\n\"delete\"), so the developer can assign rules that affect all privileges or specific privileges on\none or more resources.\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nAs with resources, creating a role is also very simple. All roles must implement\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\RoleInterface\n. This interface consists of a single method,\n\ngetRoleId()\n, Additionally, \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\GenericRole\n is provided by the\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\n component as a basic role implementation for developers to extend as needed.\n\n\nIn \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n, a role may inherit from one or more roles. This is to support\ninheritance of rules among roles. For example, a user role, such as \"sally\", may belong to one or\nmore parent roles, such as \"editor\" and \"administrator\". The developer can assign rules to \"editor\"\nand \"administrator\" separately, and \"sally\" would inherit such rules from both, without having to\nassign rules directly to \"sally\".\n\n\nThough the ability to inherit from multiple roles is very useful, multiple inheritance also\nintroduces some degree of complexity. The following example illustrates the ambiguity condition and\nhow \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n solves it.\n\n\nMultiple Inheritance among Roles\n\n\nThe following code defines three base roles - \"guest\", \"member\", and \"admin\" - from which other\nroles may inherit. Then, a role identified by \"someUser\" is established and inherits from the three\nother roles. The order in which these roles appear in the \n$parents\n array is important. When\nnecessary, \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n searches for access rules defined not only for the queried\nrole (herein, \"someUser\"), but also upon the roles from which the queried role inherits (herein,\n\"guest\", \"member\", and \"admin\"):\n\n\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl;\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\GenericRole as Role;\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Resource\\GenericResource as Resource;\n\n$acl = new Acl();\n\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('guest'))\n    -\naddRole(new Role('member'))\n    -\naddRole(new Role('admin'));\n\n$parents = array('guest', 'member', 'admin');\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('someUser'), $parents);\n\n$acl-\naddResource(new Resource('someResource'));\n\n$acl-\ndeny('guest', 'someResource');\n$acl-\nallow('member', 'someResource');\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('someUser', 'someResource') ? 'allowed' : 'denied';\n\n\n\n\nSince there is no rule specifically defined for the \"someUser\" role and \"someResource\",\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n must search for rules that may be defined for roles that \"someUser\"\ninherits. First, the \"admin\" role is visited, and there is no access rule defined for it. Next, the\n\"member\" role is visited, and \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n finds that there is a rule specifying that\n\"member\" is allowed access to \"someResource\".\n\n\nIf \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n were to continue examining the rules defined for other parent roles,\nhowever, it would find that \"guest\" is denied access to \"someResource\". This fact introduces an\nambiguity because now \"someUser\" is both denied and allowed access to \"someResource\", by reason of\nhaving inherited conflicting rules from different parent roles.\n\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n resolves this ambiguity by completing a query when it finds the first\nrule that is directly applicable to the query. In this case, since the \"member\" role is examined\nbefore the \"guest\" role, the example code would print \"allowed\".\n\n\n\n\nLIFO Order for role queries\n\n\nWhen specifying multiple parents for a role, keep in mind that the last parent listed is the first\none searched for rules applicable to an authorization query.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Access Control List\n\n\nAn Access Control List (ACL) can represent any set of physical or virtual objects that you wish.\nFor the purposes of demonstration, however, we will create a basic Content Management System (CMS)\nACL that maintains several tiers of groups over a wide variety of areas. To create a new ACL\nobject, we instantiate the ACL with no parameters:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl;\n$acl = new Acl();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenied by default\n\n\nUntil a developer specifies an \"allow\" rule, \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n denies access to every\nprivilege upon every resource by every role.\n\n\n\n\nRegistering Roles\n\n\nCMS systems will nearly always require a hierarchy of permissions to determine the authoring\ncapabilities of its users. There may be a 'Guest' group to allow limited access for demonstrations,\na 'Staff' group for the majority of CMS users who perform most of the day-to-day operations, an\n'Editor' group for those responsible for publishing, reviewing, archiving and deleting content, and\nfinally an 'Administrator' group whose tasks may include all of those of the other groups as well as\nmaintenance of sensitive information, user management, back-end configuration data, backup and\nexport. This set of permissions can be represented in a role registry, allowing each group to\ninherit privileges from 'parent' groups, as well as providing distinct privileges for their unique\ngroup only. The permissions may be expressed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nUnique Permissions\n\n\nInherit Permissions From\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuest\n\n\nView\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nEdit, Submit, Revise\n\n\nGuest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\n\n\nPublish, Archive, Delete\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrator\n\n\n(Granted all access)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\GenericRole\n is used, but any object that implements\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\RoleInterface\n is acceptable. These groups can be added to the role\nregistry as follows:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl;\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\GenericRole as Role;\n\n$acl = new Acl();\n\n// Add groups to the Role registry using Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\GenericRole\n// Guest does not inherit access controls\n$roleGuest = new Role('guest');\n$acl-\naddRole($roleGuest);\n\n// Staff inherits from guest\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('staff'), $roleGuest);\n\n/*\nAlternatively, the above could be written:\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('staff'), 'guest');\n*/\n\n// Editor inherits from staff\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('editor'), 'staff');\n\n// Administrator does not inherit access controls\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('administrator'));\n\n\n\n\nDefining Access Controls\n\n\nNow that the ACL contains the relevant roles, rules can be established that define how resources\nmay be accessed by roles. You may have noticed that we have not defined any particular resources for\nthis example, which is simplified to illustrate that the rules apply to all resources.\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n provides an implementation whereby rules need only be assigned from\ngeneral to specific, minimizing the number of rules needed, because resources and roles inherit\nrules that are defined upon their ancestors.\n\n\n\n\nSpecificity\n\n\nIn general, \nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n obeys a given rule if and only if a\nmore specific rule does not apply.\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, we can define a reasonably complex set of rules with a minimum amount of code. To\napply the base permissions as defined above:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl;\nuse Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Role\\GenericRole as Role;\n\n$acl = new Acl();\n\n$roleGuest = new Role('guest');\n$acl-\naddRole($roleGuest);\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('staff'), $roleGuest);\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('editor'), 'staff');\n$acl-\naddRole(new Role('administrator'));\n\n// Guest may only view content\n$acl-\nallow($roleGuest, null, 'view');\n\n/*\nAlternatively, the above could be written:\n$acl-\nallow('guest', null, 'view');\n */\n\n// Staff inherits view privilege from guest, but also needs additional\n// privileges\n$acl-\nallow('staff', null, array('edit', 'submit', 'revise'));\n\n// Editor inherits view, edit, submit, and revise privileges from\n// staff, but also needs additional privileges\n$acl-\nallow('editor', null, array('publish', 'archive', 'delete'));\n\n// Administrator inherits nothing, but is allowed all privileges\n$acl-\nallow('administrator');\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNULL\n values in the above \nallow()\n calls are used to indicate that the allow rules apply to\nall resources.\n\n\nQuerying an ACL\n\n\nWe now have a flexible ACL that can be used to determine whether requesters have permission to\nperform functions throughout the web application. Performing queries is quite simple using the\n\nisAllowed()\n method:\n\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('guest', null, 'view')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// allowed\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('staff', null, 'publish')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// denied\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('staff', null, 'revise')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// allowed\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('editor', null, 'view')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// allowed because of inheritance from guest\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('editor', null, 'update')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// denied because no allow rule for 'update'\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('administrator', null, 'view')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// allowed because administrator is allowed all privileges\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('administrator')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// allowed because administrator is allowed all privileges\n\necho $acl-\nisAllowed('administrator', null, 'update')\n    ? 'allowed'\n    : 'denied';\n// allowed because administrator is allowed all privileges",

In practice, however,\naccess controls tend to have exceptions and varying degrees of complexity.\n\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl\n allows to you accomplish these refinements in a straightforward and\nflexible manner.\n\n\nFor the example CMS, it has been determined that whilst the 'staff' group covers the needs of the\nvast majority of users, there is a need for a new 'marketing' group that requires access to the\nnewsletter and latest news in the CMS. The group is fairly self-sufficient and will have the\nability to publish and archive both newsletters and the latest news.\n\n\nIn addition, it has also been requested that the 'staff' group be allowed to view news stories but\nnot to revise the latest news.

In practice, however,\naccess controls tend to have exceptions and varying degrees of complexity. Zend\\Permissions\\Acl\\Acl  allows to you accomplish these refinements in a straightforward and\nflexible manner.  For the example CMS, it has been determined that whilst the 'staff' group covers the needs of the\nvast majority of users, there is a need for a new 'marketing' group that requires access to the\nnewsletter and latest news in the CMS. The group is fairly self-sufficient and will have the\nability to publish and archive both newsletters and the latest news.  In addition, it has also been requested that the 'staff' group be allowed to view news stories but\nnot to revise the latest news.
